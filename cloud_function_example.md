### Example: Deploying a Google Cloud Function Using gcloud

Below is a step-by-step example to deploy a simple Google Cloud Function from your local machine using the `gcloud` CLI, all without any external reference links.

#### 1. Prerequisites

- Google Cloud SDK installed (`gcloud`)
- You are authenticated and have a Google Cloud project set (`gcloud init`)

#### 2. Sample Python Function (main.py)

Create a file called `main.py` with the following code:

```python
def hello_world(request):
    return "Hello, World!"
```

#### 3. Create Requirements File (optional)

If your function needs extra Python packages, add a file called `requirements.txt`.  
For this simple example, it's not needed and can be left empty.
```bash
requests==2.31.0
pandas>=2.0.0
```

#### 4. Deploy the Function

Open a terminal in your function's folder and run:

```sh
gcloud functions deploy hello_world \
  --runtime python311 \
  --trigger-http \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --entry-point hello_world
```

- `hello_world`: Name of the function (change to your preference)
- `--runtime`: The Python version (e.g., `python311`)
- `--trigger-http`: Makes the function accessible by HTTP requests
- `--allow-unauthenticated`: Allows requests without authentication
- `--entry-point`: The name of the function in your code to execute

#### 5. Call Your Function

After the deployment completes, the terminal will display a URL.  
You can test the function by opening the given URL in your browser or by using curl:

```sh
gcloud functions describe hello_world --region=us-central1 --project=splendid-sled-460802-q9
```

This should return: the output find the uri and paste it in broswer

```bash
**uri:** https://hello-world-ucwvrx3aka-uc.a.run.app
```

#### 6. Clean Up

If you want to remove the function to avoid charges:

```sh
gcloud functions delete hello_world
```

#### Notes

- Adjust the Python version and function name as needed.
- For other languages (Node.js, Go, etc.), change the `--runtime` flag accordingly and write the function using that languageâ€™s syntax.
- You can trigger Cloud Functions from events such as storage changes or pub/sub, not just HTTP. Use `--trigger-topic` or `--trigger-bucket` accordingly for those cases.
